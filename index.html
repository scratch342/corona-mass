		<hr>

		<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the world badly. There are, as of now, more than 660,000 cases worldwide, and nearly 4000 in Australia. Over 30,000 people have died worldwide and 16 have died in Australia. Government all over the world, including our Australian government, are doing the right thing, encouraging social distancing and self isolation and shutting down many institions. They are also pushing for the developments of treatments and vaccines. These measures are important and very helpful in containing this virus, and <u>all</u> of the regulations should be followed. 
		</p>
		&nbsp
		<p>There are, however, actions that the Australian government could take additionally to seriously reduce the transmission rate, actions that other places have taken. The key to stopping this virus in its tracks is through intensive, mass testing. The Australian government should place a high priority on attempting to test as many people as possible in Australia, if not everyone. Countries such as South Korea and China that have done this have experienced a significant decrease in transmission rates. By testing everyone and isolating those with the virus, the transmission rate will plummet in Australia drastically.</p>
		&nbsp
		<p>So exactly what steps could Australia take to eradicate this virus as soon as possible?</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Australia should lockdown. Schools, shops, as many things as possible need to be halted.</li>
			<li>Australia should invest seriously into developing many efficient tests.</li>
			<li>Australia should focus on attempting to efficiently test everyone in the nation, possibly state by state or city by city and track down and isolate (and attempt to treat) those with the virus .</li>
			<li>Australia should remain in lockdown for as long as needed.</li>

		</ol>
